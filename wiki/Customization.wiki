How can you alter the page layout or alter the behavior.
Without altering to core files and reducing the time when you want to update. <br>

==page layout==
Normally the templates are located in a directory like.<br>
"modules\contacts\pages\template_ .php"<br>
In most cases before a template is loaded a search will be done in the customs folder of that module to check if there is a custom template if so only the custom template will be loaded.
<br>
Your custom template should be located in a directory like.<br>
"modules\contacts\custom\pages\template_ .php"<br>
The name of your custom template must be the same as the original.<br>
<br>
*be aware that you must check if you have to update your custom template after updating* it could be new features are added or new required fields.
