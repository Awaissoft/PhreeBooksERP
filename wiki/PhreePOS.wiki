on this page there are the following functions.
  * selecting a sales person. (this doesn't change the user that is logged in)
  * selecting a till.
    * a till is connected to a branch.
    * if a user is restricted to one branch the user can only select tills that are connected to that branch.
    * if there is only one till for that branch the selection box is not shown.
    * when you select a different till it will get the printer connected to that till. ( if you print over lan make sure the name for that printer is the same on all work stations.)

    * first it will look in the list of items that is already on screen. If a sku matches your entery in the sku search field and the unit_price of that sku is not null than the quantity will be increased with one. (this is done so that it is easier to add multiple lines with the same sku that has a sales price set as null 'what i call fill in at sale'.    )
    * otherwise a database search will be done. If there is a match a new line will be added to the screen and the sku search field will be selected again.
